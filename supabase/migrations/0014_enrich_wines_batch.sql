-- Atomic batch enrichment for wines. The previous /api/wines/enrich route
-- fired one UPDATE per wine via Promise.all — 500 wines = 500 concurrent
-- Supabase round-trips, connection-pool pressure, and no atomicity. The
-- enrichment values come from a deterministic rule engine (no external API),
-- so we can compute them in Node and ship the entire batch to the DB in a
-- single jsonb payload.
--
-- The function does one UPDATE with a join to jsonb_array_elements, scoped
-- to p_restaurant_id as defense-in-depth (even if a caller smuggled in ids
-- from another tenant, the restaurant filter would no-op them).
--
-- DOWN (manual, not a migration file):
--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.enrich_wines_batch(uuid, jsonb);
