-- The "public can read wines in published lists" RLS policy correlates
-- every wines row against wine_list_items.wine_id (see migration
-- 0008_public_wine_read.sql). With no index on that FK column, every
-- public-list render produces a sequential scan of wine_list_items per
-- wine row. As wine_list_items grows past a few thousand rows the
-- public /list/[slug] page becomes O(n²).
--
-- A plain btree on wine_list_items.wine_id is the right fix — the column
-- is high-cardinality (one row per (section, wine) pair) and the policy's
-- existence-check is an equality predicate. Created CONCURRENTLY would be
-- safer in production, but supabase migrations run inside a transaction
-- so we use the regular form. The table is small enough today that the
-- AccessExclusiveLock window is sub-second.
--
-- DOWN:
--   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS public.idx_wine_list_items_wine_id;

create index if not exists idx_wine_list_items_wine_id
  on public.wine_list_items (wine_id);
