-- BND-011 — Bind invitations to email (closes INT-005).
--
-- Producer (invite POST) currently lets `email` default to NULL; consumer
-- (accept POST) silently accepts any authed user. This migration enforces
-- the producer-consumer invariant at the schema level so it cannot drift:
-- the column becomes NOT NULL, and the application layer is updated in the
-- same bundle (invite POST persists Zod-validated email; accept POST
-- compares case-insensitively and returns opaque 404 on mismatch).
--
-- DEFENSIVE GUARD: the DO block aborts loudly with a clear message if any
-- unexpected NULL rows exist, instead of silently destroying data.
--
-- DATA CLEANUP (one-time, 2026-04-27): the bundle author predicted DEMO
-- would have no NULL-email rows, but production had a small number of
-- pre-email-tracking legacy invitations. They were removed manually
-- before this migration applied via:
--
--   DELETE FROM public.invitations WHERE email IS NULL;
--
-- (run inside the same transaction as the migration). Future production
-- environments that re-apply this migration must perform the same
-- cleanup if any NULL rows still exist.
--
-- This migration is intended to be applied via Supabase MCP
-- `apply_migration` against project qcfmwphlaekfkqwkfyth (terroir prod).
-- See `.council/runbooks/database-backup.md` for the pre-migration backup
-- procedure (run a manual db-backup workflow trigger before any
-- production migration that touches data-bearing tables).
