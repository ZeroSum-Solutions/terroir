-- DEBT-023 cleanup (~5 min housekeeping).
--
-- Migration 0015 shipped a column-level REVOKE on
-- is_eightysixed, eightysixed_at, eightysixed_by from authenticated,
-- labelled as the "integrity guard." It turns out Postgres column-
-- level REVOKE is a no-op when the underlying grant is table-level
-- (Supabase's bootstrap does GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
-- public TO authenticated — a table-level grant with no per-column
-- ACL rows, so there's nothing for a column-level REVOKE to
-- subtract from). Empirically confirmed:
--   has_column_privilege('authenticated', 'public.wines',
--                        'is_eightysixed', 'UPDATE')
-- still returns true, and pg_attribute.attacl for the three
-- columns is NULL.
--
-- The actual enforcement of "only owner or manager can change
-- availability" is migration 0023's BEFORE UPDATE trigger
-- wines_enforce_owner_manager_for_availability. Legitimate writes
-- go through the set_wine_availability SECURITY DEFINER RPC
-- (migration 0015), which runs as postgres and therefore bypasses
-- the trigger via current_user check.
--
-- Migrations are immutable once shipped, so we can't edit 0015 to
-- remove its misleading REVOKE statement. This migration doesn't
-- change any runtime behavior. What it does:
--
--   1. Adds COMMENT ON COLUMN annotations so future readers
--      understand where availability enforcement actually lives
--      (0023 trigger + 0015 RPC) without having to reconstruct
--      the finding from a diff search.
--
--   2. Stands as a paper-trail entry recording that 0015's REVOKE
--      was decorative. If anyone greps for "revoke update" in
--      wines-related migrations, they land here next.

comment on column public.wines.is_eightysixed is
  $$BND-037: whether this wine is 86'd (out of stock or paused). Legitimate writes go through the set_wine_availability RPC (migration 0015, SECURITY DEFINER with internal owner-or-manager check). Direct UPDATE by role authenticated / anon is blocked by the wines_enforce_owner_manager_for_availability BEFORE UPDATE trigger (migration 0023). The column-level REVOKE in 0015 is a Postgres no-op against Supabase's table-level GRANT ALL and does not contribute to enforcement — see DEBT-023 / migration 0024 docstring.$$;

comment on column public.wines.eightysixed_at is
  $$BND-037: when this wine was 86'd. Null unless is_eightysixed = true. Enforcement path is identical to is_eightysixed — see its column comment.$$;

comment on column public.wines.eightysixed_by is
  $$BND-037: user who 86'd this wine. Null for auto-86 events (migration 0021 trigger sets user_id = null in availability_events; wines.eightysixed_by stays null too when the auto path fires) and when is_eightysixed = false. Enforcement path is identical to is_eightysixed — see its column comment.$$;
