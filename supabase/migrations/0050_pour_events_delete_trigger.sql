-- 0050_pour_events_delete_trigger.sql -- BND-118
-- Adds an AFTER DELETE trigger on pour_events that reverses the
-- effect of the insert trigger, maintaining open_bottles.remaining_ml
-- consistency when pour_events rows are removed.
--
-- The insert trigger (pour_events_maintain_open_bottle) updates
-- open_bottles on INSERT. This delete trigger reverses those
-- state changes on DELETE.

-- 1. Create the delete trigger function

create or replace function public.pour_events_reverse_open_bottle()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
as $$
begin
  if OLD.kind = 'new_bottle' then
    -- new_bottle insert created or reset an open_bottles row.
    -- On delete, close the bottle since the opening event is removed.
    update public.open_bottles
      set remaining_ml = 0,
          closed_at = now()
      where wine_id = OLD.wine_id
        and restaurant_id = OLD.restaurant_id
        and closed_at is null;

  elsif OLD.kind in ('pour','spill','finish_bottle') then
    -- pour/spill/finish_bottle subtracted ml_delta from remaining_ml.
    -- On delete, add it back. Also clear closed_at if the bottle
    -- was drained by this event.
    update public.open_bottles
      set remaining_ml = remaining_ml + OLD.ml_delta,
          closed_at = null
      where wine_id = OLD.wine_id
        and restaurant_id = OLD.restaurant_id;

  elsif OLD.kind = 'reconcile' then
    -- reconcile subtracts (remaining - new_remaining) = delta from open.
    -- Reverse: add the delta back.
    update public.open_bottles
      set remaining_ml = remaining_ml + OLD.ml_delta,
          closed_at = null
      where wine_id = OLD.wine_id
        and restaurant_id = OLD.restaurant_id;
  end if;
  return OLD;
end;
$$;

-- 2. Attach the AFTER DELETE trigger

create trigger pour_events_delete_trigger
  after delete on public.pour_events
  for each row execute function public.pour_events_reverse_open_bottle();
